# Project-2
 

For Project Two, we were asked to utilise ChatGPT to generate code and continue to use CSS skills to think outside the grid and in order to create a simple experimental responsive website using a front-end framework. After the process of Project One, I entered the development of Project Two with a deeper understanding of correct uses of HTML and CSS terminology, allowing me to grasp coding language more thoroughly before generating this site. My developed understanding of the terminology of HTML and CSS also assisted me to understand the correct and most efficient ways to communicate to ChatGPT to ensure the given code was as close to my desired design as possible. Feedback from Project One was taken into consideration when building this site, with the goal to minimise and refine repetitive and exessive CSS applications.

My Ecommerce website inspiration was drawn from Cotton On with images and videos gathered from Pexels. I admire the simplicity of the website design of Cotton On, with strong usages of imagery, focus on pricing and current sales and consistent container heights and colour palettes. From this influence, I chose to design an Ecommerce site for "Thrifted", a second-hand and vintage clothing store.

Initially, utilising ChatGPT was quite intimidating as I knew of its capabilities, however, had never used it in practice nor to generate code. I further utilised Bootstrap within the development of this site to create button designs, however, the process was slightly confusing and tedious, hence I leaned more toward the implementation of ChatGPT code instead.

Using ChatGPT made the coding and design process much quicker and smoother with its ability to generate both HTML and CSS assets and provided a detailed explanation of what each element meant. I began the process of developing my own header and asking to "style nav bar content in CSS to be centred, white colour and turn black when hovering". This design had worked mostly, with my need to change colour and font styling, however, the hover element worked well. Later, I asked to "create a header with the logo "THRIFTED" aligned left, and pages "about", "shop" and "checkout/cart" aligned right. When hovering over pages make the words black. Make responsive", allowing my header design to be more legible and align with the design style of the website.

For creating the hero image, I utilised my knowledge and coding from Project One to establish a framework for the design. With the help of ChatGPT, I was able to create a header, body copy and button in a container to hover over the image to create a visually appealing design when first accessing the site.

The second container for this site encountered a challenge, as I initially asked to generate a three-column row, with an image covering two sections and text in the other third. My image sizing faced issues as I could not get the image to span over the two columns. To solve this, I asked to generate a two-column row, which successfully placed the image to the correct size and text perfectly to its right. Furthermore, media queries were a slight issue for this aspect too, as layering the columns vertically hid the image display under the hero image. To fix this, I reduced image, text and container sizing which allowed the image to be presented above the text-column div.

Initially, the website had a 'New and Trending' container featuring popular products the site sold. This design positioned nicely for desktop screens, although, when becoming responsive the columns just reduced in size. With my knowledge in addition to ChatGPT, I tried to flex align the row into a column, however, ran into the problem of all the columns disappearing behind other container content. This problem was not solved in time, so, unfortunately, was removed from the site.

Implementing the video container was a new coding style I hadn't utilised before and is an effective visual element in terms of the design of the website. Coding this was challenging, ensuring the video was displayed with the text on top was difficult. Firstly, gaining the correct URL to display the video was different to my expectations, and followed a different form to the implementation of images. With the assistance of ChatGPT asking "create a container with a title aligned left with a background video", the video was successfully uploaded with slight manual adjustments to the text.

Finally, the scroll element was also a new coding practice. Initially, I asked to "make a carousel scroll in HTML and CSS with images and text hovering over images". After implementing this code and realising I asked for the wrong design, I asked: "make a horizontal scroll in HTML and CSS with images and text hovering over images". This also did not generate the design I was desiring, then asking "make a horizontal scroll with 8 cards with background images", this statement successfully generated the horizontal scroll. After placing the photos, this container is successfully responsive and visually appealing.

Overall, the experience of creating a website utilising ChatGPT was very enjoyable. It increased my knowledge of coding elements and styling selectors and increased the speed of generating the site with the consideration of responsive code for desktop, tablet and mobile. From this process, it is clear the specificity of wording needed to ensure desired design and content code is created, with running into errors including cantering content or content being placed in columns I unintended to. Thus, being very clear with wording and terminology was essential to ensure the correct code was generated.
